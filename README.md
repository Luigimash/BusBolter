Bus Bolter is an android app that gives you the fastest transit route to a destination. Simply enter an origin and destination address/place/intersection, and we'll do the rest. By factoring in distance and transit arrival times, we provide the most accurate tool to ensure you get where you need to be the fastest.

# Features and Function

Using the [Google Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro#TravelModes), we determine the fastest route to your destination, based on the bus schedule at the time. Your locations can be entered as a street intersection, an address, a postal code, or a place name. For example: Finch Avenue and Pharmacy Avenue, 3250 Pharmacy Avenue, M3Q 3M4, or University of Windsor are all valid locations. 

With an internet or data connection, you can rest assured that you are always getting the fastest transit directions to your destination at any moment.
